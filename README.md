### My name is Tribikram Thapa (Rana). I have a background in Physiotherapy, and currently work as a Research Fellow at Monash University.

#### I aim to transition into finance with the hope of using blockchain technology in the banking sector. I chose FinTech as a course because it combines my passion in programming and finance.

##### This repository will contain my homework for units taught weekly. The folder names below are hyperlinked to their respective directories.
