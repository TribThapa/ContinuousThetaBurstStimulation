# cTBS_study

### This repository contains all scripts used to analyse data in the cTBS study. 

#### Briefly:

    -The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive, multi-modal assessment of how cTBS over DLPFC alters brain activity and connectivity, as well as subsequent working memory performance. 
    
    - We measured changes in local and remote GABA concentration, functional connectivity and low-frequency fluctuations at rest, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity during an n-back working memory task and working memory performance. 

    -Based on available evidence, we expected increases in local GABA concentration, reductions in low-frequency fluctuations, reductions in functional connectivity with the stimulated site, reductions in DLPFC BOLD activity during working memory, and impaired working memory performance following cTBS. 

    -Where possible, we used a combination of frequentist and Bayesian statistical tests to assess evidence for and against the null-hypotheses.
